Expense Report Instructions

1. Submit expense reports within 30 days of the expense date. Late submissions may be declined unless a valid justification is provided and approved by your line manager. Ensure all entries are accurate and supported by receipts.

2. Acceptable expenses include reasonable business meals, local transportation, accommodation for approved travel, and event fees related to work. Non-reimbursable items include personal entertainment, family-related costs, and fines or penalties.

3. Receipts must be legible and itemized. Credit card slips alone are not sufficient. For digital receipts, upload clear scans or photos in PDF or JPG format. For foreign currency receipts, the system applies the European Central Bank daily exchange rate unless a company card statement is attached.

4. Mileage claims must include date, route, business purpose, and total kilometers. The reimbursement rate follows the annually reviewed Swiss guideline published on the intranet. Parking and tolls require separate receipts when available.

5. Each report must be approved by the employee’s line manager and, if exceeding the threshold amount, by Finance. Approvals should be completed within five business days to ensure timely reimbursement in the next payroll cycle.

6. For any questions about specific expense categories or exceptions, contact Finance via the Expenses Helpdesk queue. The team can pre-approve unusual cases when justified by business needs and policy.
