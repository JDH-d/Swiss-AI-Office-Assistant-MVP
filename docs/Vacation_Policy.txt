Vacation Policy (Switzerland)

1. Entitlement: Full-time employees receive 25 working days of paid vacation per calendar year unless otherwise stated in the employment contract. Part-time entitlements are pro-rated based on contractual working percentage. Entitlement accrues monthly.

2. Planning and Approval: Vacation should be requested in advance through the HR system and approved by the line manager. Managers balance team workload, customer needs, and fairness. While preferences are considered, final scheduling remains a managerial decision.

3. Carry-Over: Up to five days may be carried into the following year with manager approval and should be used by 31 March. Larger carry-overs require HR approval and a documented business reason.

4. Illness During Vacation: If you become ill during vacation, inform your manager promptly and obtain a medical certificate for the affected days. Valid days may be re-credited as vacation according to the Sick Leave Procedure and applicable law.

5. Payouts: Vacation is generally to be taken as time off. Payout of unused days occurs only upon termination or when explicitly authorised by HR in exceptional circumstances.

6. Public Holidays: Public holidays do not count as vacation days. The applicable public holiday calendar follows your primary workplace canton.

7. Record Keeping: Employees are responsible for requesting and confirming their vacation in the HR system. HR audits balances periodically to ensure compliance with statutory and company requirements.
