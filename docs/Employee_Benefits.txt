Employee Benefits Overview

1. Health and Accident Insurance: The company provides mandatory accident insurance and contributes to supplementary health coverage according to local practice. Detailed plan summaries, including deductibles and coverage limits, are available on the intranet. Employees may opt for additional voluntary coverage at their own cost.

2. Pension (BVG/LPP): Employees are enrolled in the pension scheme from the first eligible salary month. Both employee and employer contribute according to age bands defined by the plan. Annual statements are issued, and voluntary buy-ins are possible subject to fund rules.
