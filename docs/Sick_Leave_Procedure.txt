Sick Leave Procedure (Switzerland)

1. If you are unwell and unable to work, inform your line manager as soon as reasonably possible, ideally before your scheduled start time. Please provide a brief description of your condition and an expected timeline for recovery if known. Your manager will record the absence and coordinate interim coverage of duties.

2. For absences exceeding two consecutive calendar days, a medical certificate (Arbeitsunfähigkeitszeugnis) from a licensed physician is required. The certificate should be submitted to HR and your manager by the third day of absence. Scanned copies are accepted; please retain the original for your records.

3. During your sick leave, HR may contact you to confirm your wellbeing and to clarify any administrative points, such as insurance reporting or payroll treatment. Your privacy is respected. Only information necessary for compliance and payroll will be recorded.

4. Salary continuation complies with Swiss Code of Obligations and our company policy. In most cases, employees receive continued pay during the qualified sick period, subject to tenure and applicable cantonal practice. HR can clarify exact entitlements upon request.

5. If you become ill while on holiday, please notify your manager and HR promptly. With a valid medical certificate, the affected days may be re-credited as vacation, in line with policy and local law.

6. Upon return to work, please update your manager and ensure all required documentation has been submitted. If a gradual return or work accommodations are recommended, coordinate with HR to arrange an appropriate plan.
